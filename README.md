# DDPG-Pendulum

Implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn to stabilize a inverted pendulum.

The code is as simple as possible to be easily understandable and to be reused in more complex projects.
That is why I also removed the dependency on the gym libraries for simplicity and to have a self-contained code.
